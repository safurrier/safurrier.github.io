I'm an experienced data scientist focused on applied, end-to-end machine learning. In my work I use technical skills (in particular python stack) with an emphasis on communication and systematic, creative problem solving with a passion for all things data and the story it can tell.

Things I'm interested in:

 * Learning new things

 * Good stories (books, movies, TV, etc)

 * Good people (friends, family, colleagues, etc)

 * Interesting ideas communicated clearly (podcasts, longform journalism, blogs, etc)

 * Anodyne list writing
